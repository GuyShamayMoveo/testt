I have:
- [ ] deleted all irrelevant comments, logs and debuggers.
- [ ] assure that I don't print full error stacks, full body response or headers from the server in the console.
- [ ] deleted all sensitive information from the code because it's being imported from environment variables.

- [ ] sanitized all user inputs to prevent attacks.

- [ ] made sure that my code is readable.

- [ ] tested the code locally and it works as expected.
- [ ] added validations and error handling in relevant cases (external requests, integrations, etc).
